If you're writing an R package that uses `reticulate` as an interface to a
Python session, you likely also need to install one or more Python packages on
the user's machine for your package to function. In addition, you'd likely
prefer to insulate users from details around how Python + `reticulate` are
configured as much as possible. This vignette documents a few approaches for
accomplishing these goals.


## Manual Configuration

Previously, packages like [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com)
accomplished this by providing helper functions (e.g.
`tensorflow::install_tensorflow()`), and documenting that users
should call this function to prepare the environment. For example:

```R
library(tensorflow)
install_tensorflow()
# use tensorflow
```

The biggest downside with this approach is that it requires users to manually
download and install an appropriate version of Python. In addition, if the user
has _not_ downloaded an appropriate version of Python, then the version
discovered on the user's system may not conform with the requirements imposed by
the `tensorflow` package -- leading to more trouble.

Fixing this often requires instructing the user to install Python, and then use
`reticulate` APIs (e.g. `reticulate::use_python()` and other tools) to find
and use an appropriate Python version + environment. This is, understandably,
more cognitive overhead than you might want to impose on users of your package.


## Automatic Configuration

With newer versions of `reticulate`, it's possible for client packages to
declare their Python dependencies directly in the `DESCRIPTION` file, with
the use of the `reticulate@R` field. For example, if we had a package `rscipy`
that acted as an interface to the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) Python package,
we might use the following `DESCRIPTION`:

```
Package: rscipy
Title: An R Interface to scipy
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Provides an R interface to the Python package scipy.
reticulate@R: list(
    packages = list(
        c(package = "scipy", pip = TRUE)
    )
    )
< ... other fields ...>
```

With this, `reticulate` will take care of automatically configuring a Python
environment for the user when the `rscipy` package is loaded and used. In
particular, after the `rscipy` package is loaded, the following will occur:

1. Unless the user has explicitly instructed `reticulate` to use an existing
   Python environment, `reticulate` prompt the user to download and install
   [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (if necessary).

2. After this, when the Python session is initialized by `reticulate`, all
   declared dependencies of loaded packages in `reticulate@R` will be
   discovered.

3. These dependencies will then be installed into an appropriate Conda
   environment, as provided by the Miniconda installation.

In effect, users have to pay a one-time, mostly-automated initialization cost in
order to use your package, and then things will then work as any other R package
would. In particular, users are otherwise insulated from details as to how
`reticulate` works.

In some cases, a user may try to load your package after Python has already been
initialized. To ensure that `reticulate` can still configure the active Python
environment, you can include the code:

```R
.onLoad <- function(libname, pkgname) {
  reticulate::configure_environment(pkgname)
}
```

This will instruct `reticulate` to immediately try to configure the active
Python environment, installing any required Python packages as necessary.


## Working Well with Others

With automatic configuration, `reticulate` wants to encourage a world wherein
different R packages wrapping Python packages can live together in the same
Python environment. In essence, we would like to minimize the number of
conflicts that could arise through different R packages having incompatible
Python dependencies.

To that effect, `reticulate` will (by default) track an older version of Python
than the current release, giving Python packages time to adapt as is required.
Python 2 will not be supported.

Tools for breaking these rules are not yet implemented, but will be provided
as the need arises.


## Format

Declared Python package dependencies should have the following format:

- **package**: The name of the Python package.

- **pip**: Whether this package should be retrieved from the
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org) with `pip`, or (if `FALSE`) from the Anaconda
  repositories.
